===================
 Pbrain repository
===================

This is the development repository for pbrain.

See http://nipy.sourceforge.net/pbrain for the introductory docs.

You may well want the example CT and EEG data at http://nipy.sourceforge.net/example_data 

We (the nipy team) don't maintain pbrain - please feel free to dive in
and take charge if you find it useful.

Please say hello on the nipy mailing list - http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/nipy-devel
