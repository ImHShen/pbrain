===================
 Pbrain repository
===================

This is the development repository for pbrain.

Pbrain is an analysis package for EEG, electrocorticography, and
structural data.  The main developer was John Hunter, who was then at
the university of Chicago.  More recently Micheal Castelle has been in
charge of maintenance.

See http://nipy.sourceforge.net/pbrain for the introductory docs.

You may well want the example CT and EEG data at http://nipy.sourceforge.net/example_data 

We (the nipy team) don't maintain pbrain - please feel free to dive in
and take charge if you find it useful.

Please say hello on the nipy mailing list - http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/nipy-devel
